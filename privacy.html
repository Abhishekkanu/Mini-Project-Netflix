                This Privacy Statement explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use
                the "Netflix service” to access “Netflix content” as those terms are defined in the Netflix Terms of Use

                functionalities or apps that are part of the Netflix service may also provide you with contextual
                privacy information or choices, in addition to the information and choices described in this Privacy
                Statement. Please note that this Privacy Statement may be easier to navigate when viewed on your web

                        address, and other identifiers you provide to us. If you subscribe to an ad supported
                        subscription plan, we also collect gender and date of birth.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Payment details: We collect your payment details, and other information to process your

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Usage information: We collect information about your interaction with the Netflix service
                        (including playback events, such as play, pause, etc.), choices made when engaging with
                        interactive titles, your Netflix game activity (such as gameplay, game use and interaction
                        information, and progress or saved game information), Netflix viewing and gaming history, search
                        queries on the Netflix service, and other information about your use and interaction with the

                        access for QR-code and similar functionality).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Advertising information: If you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan, we collect
                        information about the ads on Netflix (“Advertisements,” as defined in the Netflix Terms of Use)
                        that you view or interact with, device information (such as resettable device identifiers), IP
                        addresses, and information provided by Advertising Companies (such as information about your
                        likely interests they have collected or inferred from your visits to other websites and apps).
                        We use this information to display Advertisements to you in the Netflix service (including
                        behavioral advertisements in accordance with your preferences).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Communications: If you communicate with Netflix (such as contacting customer support via online
                        chat or voice call), engage in our surveys or feedback requests (such as when you cancel), we
                        collect the contents of such communications. We also collect details of communications that we
                        send you (such as via email, push notifications, text message, or within the Netflix service),
                        and information about your interaction and engagement with these communications.</li>

                <h3>International Transfers of Personal Information</h3>
                <p>Netflix operates from various countries around the world, as do its Service Providers, Partners, and
                    other third parties to whom we may need to disclose your personal information, as described above.
                    This means that when you use or interact with Netflix, your personal information may be transferred
                    to other countries that have different data protection laws than those where you reside.
                </p>

                <p>However, whenever we transfer personal information to other countries, we ensure that the personal
                    information is transferred in accordance with applicable data protection laws and this Privacy
                    Statement. Specifically, we use a variety of contractual, technical, and organizational measures as
                    appropriate for such transfers, including data protection agreements, technical protections, and
                    practices to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests.</p>

                <h3>Section B: Your Rights and Controls</h3>
                <ul></ul>
                <li>Access, correct, update, or delete your personal information: You have a right to confirm whether we
                    process your personal information and to access and receive a copy of the personal information we
                    process about you. You may also correct or update out-of-date or inaccurate personal information or
                    request that we delete personal information that we hold about you.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Objection, restriction, and withdrawal of consent: You can object to or request that we restrict
                    processing of your personal information. If we have collected and are processing your personal
                    information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your
                    consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor
                    will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing
                    grounds other than consent.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Right to complain: You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our
                    processing of your personal information but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions
                    or concerns.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Right not to be subject to automated decision making: You may have a right not to be subject to a
                    decision made solely using automated means, where such decision would have a legal effect on you or
                    produce a similarly significant effect.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Email and Text Messages. If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email
                    or text message, please access the “Notification settings” option for the relevant profile within
                    the “Account” section of our website. Alternatively, click the “unsubscribe” link in the email or
                    reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message (note: you may receive a confirmation
                    text message in this case). Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from transactional messages from
                    us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Push Notifications. You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. Netflix will
                    send you push notifications from time to time in accordance with any notification preferences you
                    have set on your mobile device. If you later decide you no longer want to receive these
                    notifications, you can use your mobile device’s settings to turn them off (or via the “Notification
                    settings” described in the preceding section). Please note that individual Netflix games may have
                    their own push notifications (you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them
                    off). We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those
                    notifications and later decide you no longer want to receive them, you can use your browser’s
                    settings to turn them off.</li>
                <br>
                <p>Matched Identifier Communications from Netflix. Some third party services allow us to reach users
                    with online marketing about Netflix content or the Netflix service by sending privacy protected
                    contact information to the third party. Privacy protected contact information means we use
                    deidentification technologies to convert the original contact information (such as an email address
                    or phone number) into a value (typically a long alphanumeric sequence of characters) to keep the
                    original information from being revealed. The third party compares Netflix’s privacy protected
                    contact information with privacy protected contact information in its own database and there will be
                    a match only if you have used the same contact information with Netflix and the third party. If
                    there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send Netflix marketing to you on that
                    third party service, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of such marketing. You
                    can indicate your choices in the “Privacy and data settings” (for the relevant profile) within the
                    “Account” section of our website.
